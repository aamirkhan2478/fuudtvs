<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 FUUDTVS <a name="about-project"></a>

Degree tracking system will allow the students to track their
degree and check the status of their application of degree. This
will facilitate both the students and the university
administration. In past the process of applying and receiving the
degree was manual. That takes lot of time and many students have
to come to university again and again to check the status of their
degree .but this system will allow the students to check their
degree status by sitting at home and they will have to just come
for once to apply for the degree and then after all the process is
done to collect the degree/ transcript. The administration will
also be facilitated by this tracking system so that they will not
have to face the rush of students every day. The system will also
provide a better working environment for the administration to
work in easy and effective way so that they will not have to face
the rush of students every day. They can save time and work in
more efficient way.
